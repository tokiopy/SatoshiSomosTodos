## Who Are We?

![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-20 at 12 16 10_5d892444](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/565da754-73ce-4db3-8cee-63277e892351)

We are **Emmanuel Fermín (Tokio)** and **Sandra Rivas (Saviria)**, a Dominican couple passionate about financial freedom and the transformational power of Bitcoin. Together, we founded **Satoshi Somos Todos**, a grassroots movement born in the heart of the Caribbean with one mission: to bring Bitcoin education, adoption, and real-world usage to every corner of the Dominican Republic.

Our commitment goes far beyond social media. We're out in the streets, in small shops, neighborhoods, and public schools.  
**We believe in the power of educated and empowered people, not in dependence on the fiat system.**

## Why "Satoshi Somos Todos"?

Because there’s no elite.  
Because there’s no single leader.  
Because **Bitcoin belongs to the people**.  
Because anyone who chooses to learn, share, and use Bitcoin… **is part of Satoshi’s legacy**.
